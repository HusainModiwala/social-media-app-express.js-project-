## Order of execution for request handling in case of various routes.

1. Middleware Execution in user.routes.js:
When a request is made to the /api/v1/users/register endpoint, the userRouter middleware in user.routes.js is triggered.
Inside user.routes.js, the route /register is matched, and the registerUser controller function is specified as the handler for this route.

2. Execution of registerUser in user.controller.js:
The registerUser controller function is wrapped by the asyncHandler function in user.controller.js. This wrapping is essentially creating a new function that has the error-handling logic from asyncHandler.
When the route handler (i.e., the registerUser function) is executed due to a matching route, it's actually the wrapped version of registerUser provided by asyncHandler that gets executed.
This wrapped version includes the error-handling logic from asyncHandler.

3. Execution Inside asyncHandler:
The wrapped function within asyncHandler is an asynchronous function (req, res, next) => { ... }.
Inside this asynchronous function, await requestHandler(req, res, next) is used to execute the original registerUser function.
If any errors occur during the execution of registerUser, the catch block in asyncHandler handles them by calling next(err).
So, to be clear, the registerUser function is indeed executed, but it is executed within the context of the asynchronous function generated by asyncHandler. The purpose of asyncHandler is to provide consistent error handling for asynchronous operations in your route handlers/controllers.
